# About this repo

Forked from [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)

# The Ultimate vimrc

I would of course recommend using the awesome version.c

## How to install the Awesome version?
The awesome version includes a lot of great plugins, configurations and color schemes that make Vim a lot better. To install it simply do following:

	git clone https://github.com/keekun/my_new_vim_configuration.git ~/.vim_runtime
	sh ~/.vim_runtime/install_awesome_vimrc.sh
